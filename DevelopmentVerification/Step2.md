# SafeStream Development - Step 2 Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all changes and verifications performed in Step 2 of the SafeStream project, focusing on developer tooling, Docker scaffolding, and improved documentation.

---

## 1. Developer Tooling

- **pre-commit**
  - Added `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with hooks for `black` (auto-formatting) and `ruff` (linting and auto-fix).
  - Added `pre-commit` to `[project.optional-dependencies].dev` in `pyproject.toml`.
  - Installed and activated pre-commit hooks (`pre-commit install`).
  - Updated `[tool.black]` and `[tool.ruff]` sections in `pyproject.toml` for consistent formatting and linting across the project.

---

## 2. Dockerisation (Scaffold)

- **Dockerfile**
  - Based on `python:3.12-slim`.
  - Copies code, installs dependencies from `pyproject.toml`, creates logs directory.
  - Runs `uvicorn app.main:app` as the default command.
  - Includes TODO comments for future multi-stage builds and Streamlit dashboard service.

- **docker-compose.yml**
  - Defines a single `api` service exposing port 8000.
  - Mounts the logs directory as a volume.
  - Sets environment variables for app configuration.
  - Healthcheck on `/healthz` endpoint.
  - Commented placeholders for future `dashboard` (Streamlit) and `db` (Postgres) services.
  - Removed obsolete `version` field to avoid warnings.

---

## 3. Documentation

- **docs/DEV_SETUP.md**
  - Step-by-step instructions for local venv setup and Docker Compose workflow.
  - Pre-commit installation and usage.
  - Code quality and testing commands.
  - Troubleshooting and environment variable notes.
  - References to relevant sections in the main README.

---

## 4. Verification

- **Docker Build and Run**
  - `docker build -t safestream .` builds the image successfully.
  - `docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name safestream-test safestream` starts the container.
  - `curl http://localhost:8000/` returns `{ "status": "ok" }`.
  - `curl http://localhost:8000/healthz` returns `{ "status": "healthy" }`.
  - `docker compose up --build -d` works as expected with the compose file.

- **pre-commit**
  - `pre-commit install` sets up hooks.
  - `pre-commit run --all-files` checks and auto-fixes code style and linting issues.

---

## Key Achievements

- Automated code quality checks on every commit.
- Reproducible, containerized development and deployment workflow.
- Clear, actionable documentation for all developers.
- Verified that the API service is accessible and healthy in both local and Dockerized environments.

---

## Next Steps

- Implement the WebSocket route `/ws/{username}` and in-memory socket management (Stage 2 of the build guide).
- Add more comprehensive tests and CI integration.
- Expand Docker Compose to include the dashboard and database services as the project evolves.
