# Session Persistence Test Verification

This document outlines how to test the session persistence functionality that was implemented to fix the "user session lost on page refresh" bug.

## üêõ Bug Fixed
**Issue**: Users were logged out whenever they refreshed the page or reopened the tab, breaking expected web app behavior.

**Solution**: Implemented industry-standard JWT token persistence with automatic validation and session restoration.

## ‚úÖ Features Implemented

1. **Token Storage**: JWT tokens are securely stored in localStorage
2. **Automatic Validation**: Stored tokens are validated against the backend on page load
3. **Session Restoration**: Valid sessions are automatically restored without requiring re-login
4. **Graceful Expiration**: Expired tokens are automatically cleared and users are logged out
5. **Error Handling**: Network errors and authentication failures are handled gracefully

## üß™ Test Steps

### Test 1: Basic Session Persistence
1. Start the SafeStream application:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```
2. Open browser to `http://localhost:8000/chat`
3. Login with demo credentials (e.g., `demo_user` / `demo123`)
4. Verify you're logged in and can send messages
5. **Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)**
6. ‚úÖ **Expected**: You should remain logged in and connected to chat
7. ‚ùå **Before fix**: You would be logged out and see the login modal

### Test 2: Session Restoration After Browser Restart
1. Login to SafeStream as above
2. Close the entire browser
3. Reopen browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/chat`
4. ‚úÖ **Expected**: You should be automatically logged in (if token hasn't expired)

### Test 3: Expired Token Handling
1. Login to SafeStream
2. Wait for token to expire (default: 30 minutes) OR modify `JWT_EXPIRE_MINUTES=1` in environment for faster testing
3. Try to refresh the page after token expires
4. ‚úÖ **Expected**: You should be automatically logged out and see the login modal

### Test 4: Network Error Handling
1. Login to SafeStream
2. Stop the backend server
3. Refresh the page
4. ‚úÖ **Expected**: Should handle the network error gracefully and show login modal

## üîç Console Log Verification

When testing, check the browser console for these helpful log messages:

- `"Validating stored authentication token..."` - When checking stored token
- `"Session restored for user: [username]"` - When session is successfully restored
- `"Stored token is invalid or expired, clearing session"` - When token is expired
- `"Authentication failed, logging out user"` - When WebSocket authentication fails

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Details

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Enhanced `checkAuthStatus()` function**:
   - Now validates tokens with backend `/auth/me` endpoint
   - Handles expired/invalid tokens gracefully
   - Provides detailed logging

2. **Improved WebSocket error handling**:
   - Detects authentication failures (codes 1007, 1008)
   - Validates tokens before reconnection attempts
   - Automatic logout on auth failures

3. **Better error handling**:
   - Added `handleAuthError()` utility function
   - Automatic session cleanup on token expiration
   - Graceful degradation on network errors

### Files Modified:
- `SafeStream/static/js/main.js` - Enhanced authentication and session management

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

After implementing these changes:
- [ ] Users stay logged in after page refresh
- [ ] Sessions persist after browser restart (until token expires)
- [ ] Expired tokens are handled gracefully
- [ ] No more unexpected logouts due to page refresh
- [ ] Console shows clear authentication status messages
- [ ] WebSocket reconnection works properly with valid tokens

## üöÄ Production Readiness

This implementation follows industry best practices:
- JWT tokens stored in localStorage (standard for SPAs)
- Server-side token validation before use
- Graceful error handling and user feedback
- Automatic cleanup of invalid sessions
- No sensitive data stored in frontend beyond the token itself

The solution provides a smooth user experience while maintaining security best practices.
