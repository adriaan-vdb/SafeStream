- **Sample Data Fixtures**: Created `sample_chat_message` and `sample_gift_event` fixtures with TODO(stage-N) markers.
- **Future-Ready**: All fixtures include clear documentation and stage-based TODOs.

### tests/test_smoke.py

- **OpenAPI Testing**: Added tests for `/docs` and `/openapi.json` endpoints.
- **Schema Validation**: Tests verify FastAPI's automatic OpenAPI schema generation.
- **Future Test Placeholders**: Added TODO(stage-2) and TODO(stage-4) comments for WebSocket and gift API tests.
- **Clean Structure**: Removed unused imports and improved test organization.

## 2. GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

### .github/workflows/ci.yml
- **Multi-Python Support**: Tests against Python 3.12 and 3.13.
- **Dependency Caching**: Implements pip caching for faster builds.
- **Quality Checks**: Runs `ruff check .` and `black --check .`.
- **Test Execution**: Runs `pytest -q` with artifact upload.
- **Trigger Configuration**: Runs on push to main/develop and all PRs.
- **Artifact Management**: Uploads test results with 7-day retention.

### CI Workflow Features
- **Matrix Strategy**: Tests multiple Python versions simultaneously.
- **Cache Optimization**: Uses hash-based caching for pyproject.toml changes.
- **Error Handling**: Always uploads artifacts for debugging.
- **Modern Actions**: Uses latest versions of checkout, setup-python, and cache actions.

---

## 3. Code Quality Improvements

### pyproject.toml Updates
- **Ruff Configuration**: Migrated to new `[tool.ruff.lint]` section format.
- **Deprecated Settings**: Removed obsolete top-level ruff settings.
- **Python Version**: Updated target versions to Python 3.13.
- **Classifier Updates**: Added Python 3.13 to project classifiers.

### Quality Enforcement
- **Black Formatting**: All files pass `black --check .` with 88-character line length (the only formatter)
- **Ruff Linting**: All files pass `ruff check .` with comprehensive rule set (no formatting)
- **Import Sorting**: Automatic import organization and unused import removal (via Ruff linting)
- **Code Style**: Consistent formatting across all Python files (enforced by Black)

---

## 4. Enhanced Placeholder Documentation

### app/main.py
- **Specific TODOs**: Updated comments to reference exact README steps.
- **Environment Variables**: Added specific config variable names (APP_PORT, TOXIC_THRESHOLD).
- **Integration Points**: Clear references to other modules (app.moderation).
- **API Endpoints**: Specific endpoint paths (/ws/{username}, POST /api/gift).

### app/schemas.py
- **Protocol Alignment**: TODOs reference exact JSON protocols from README.
- **Pydantic Integration**: Clear path to Pydantic model implementation.
- **API Documentation**: Comments match README API specification exactly.

### app/events.py
- **Configuration Integration**: References GIFT_RATE_SEC environment variable.
- **Protocol Compliance**: TODOs match README gift event JSON format.
- **Async Implementation**: Clear async/await patterns for future development.

### app/moderation.py
- **Threshold Configuration**: References TOXIC_THRESHOLD (default 0.6).
- **Return Types**: Specific Tuple[bool, float] return type documentation.
- **Integration Points**: Clear connection to main application.

### app/db.py
- **Model Documentation**: Enhanced docstrings explaining purpose of each model.
- **Audit Trail**: Clear documentation of moderation tracking requirements.
- **Analytics Support**: Documentation for message analytics capabilities.

## 5. Local CI Testing

### scripts/test-ci.sh
- **CI Simulation**: Replicates exact GitHub Actions workflow locally.
- **Python Version Check**: Verifies Python environment.
- **Dependency Installation**: Tests pip install with dev dependencies.
- **Quality Checks**: Runs ruff and black checks.
- **Test Execution**: Runs pytest with expected output.
- **Success Indicators**: Clear success/failure messaging.

---

## 6. Verification Results

### All Quality Checks Pass
- ✅ `black --check .`: All files properly formatted (Black is the only formatter)
- ✅ `ruff check .`: No linting errors or warnings (Ruff is not used for formatting)
- ✅ `pytest -q`: 4 tests pass (100% success rate)
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks: All hooks pass (Black for formatting, Ruff for linting)
- ✅ Docker build: Container builds and runs successfully
- ✅ Docker Compose: Multi-service orchestration works

### Test Coverage
- **HTTP Endpoints**: Root, health, OpenAPI docs, and schema endpoints tested
- **FastAPI Features**: Automatic OpenAPI generation verified
- **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and JSON responses
- **Future Ready**: Test structure prepared for WebSocket and gift API tests

---

## Key Achievements

1. **Production-Ready CI/CD**: Automated testing and quality checks for all commits.
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Enhanced test infrastructure ready for complex features.
3. **Code Quality**: Automated formatting and linting with zero tolerance for style issues.
4. **Clear Roadmap**: Detailed TODO comments linking to README development steps.
5. **Local Verification**: Tools to test CI workflow before pushing to GitHub.
6. **Multi-Environment**: Support for Python 3.12 and 3.13 with matrix testing.

---

## Next Steps (Stage 4)

The project is now ready for Stage 4 implementation:
- **WebSocket Chat**: Implement `/ws/{username}` endpoint with real-time messaging
- **Message Broadcasting**: Add in-memory socket management
- **Pydantic Schemas**: Create proper data models for chat messages
- **Integration Testing**: Add WebSocket E2E tests using the prepared fixtures

---

## Technical Decisions

1. **Pytest Fixtures**: Chose fixtures over direct imports for better test isolation and reusability.
2. **Matrix Testing**: Support multiple Python versions to catch compatibility issues early.
3. **Modern Ruff**: Updated to new configuration format for future compatibility.
4. **Comprehensive TODOs**: Detailed placeholder comments to guide future development.
5. **Local CI Testing**: Script to verify CI workflow before GitHub deployment.

This foundation provides a robust, automated, and well-documented starting point for the next phase of SafeStream development.
