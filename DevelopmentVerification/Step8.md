# Stage 8: Live Metrics, UI, and Quality Verification

## Overview

This stage completes the frontend polish for SafeStream by adding TikTok-style animated gift badges, a minimal smoke test, and a unified developer verification script. All backend APIs, payloads, and logging remain unchanged.

## Accomplishments

- **Live Metrics Badge:**
  - Added a fixed badge to `/chat` showing live viewer and gift counts (`#live-metrics`).
  - Badge updates in real-time via `/metrics` polling and WebSocket events.

- **Metrics API:**
  - `/metrics` endpoint returns `viewer_count`, `gift_count`, and `toxic_pct`.
  - Integrated with chat and gift events for live updates.

- **Frontend Integration:**
  - Badge is styled and visible at top-left of `/chat`.
  - JavaScript updates badge every 5s and on live events.

- **Automated UI & Integration Tests:**
  - Playwright and Pytest tests verify badge presence, metrics updates, and UI functionality.
  - Test for badge presence in HTML, JS, and CSS.

- **Code Quality & CI:**
  - Black formatting, Ruff linting, and mypy type checks all pass.
  - All tests pass in CI and local scripts.
  - Dev script checks badge presence with `curl`.

- **Self-contained Verification:**
  - Step8 script now auto-starts/stops the server for tests.

---

**Result:**
- Real-time metrics are visible and tested.
- All code quality and integration checks pass.
- Project is ready for further enhancements.

## Features Implemented

- **Animated Gift Badges:**
  - Every incoming `"gift"` WebSocket payload spawns a bright pink badge (üéÅ √ó amount) that floats upward and fades out, evoking TikTok LIVE.
  - Styling, timing, and positioning are randomized for a lively effect.
- **Integration Hook:**
  - The browser-side WebSocket handler calls the new animation logic for every gift event.
- **Frontend Smoke Test:**
  - A pytest-based test ensures `/chat` loads and key elements are present.
- **Unified Verification Script:**
  - A single bash script (`DevelopmentVerification/Step8.bash`) runs linting, formatting, the smoke test, and static asset checks.
- **README Update:**
  - The frontend section now mentions "animated gift badges."

## How to Verify (Developer Guide)

### 1. Run the Verification Script

```bash
cd SafeStream
./DevelopmentVerification/Step8.bash
```

### 2. What the Script Checks
- **Code Quality:**
  - Black formatting
  - Ruff linting
  - Pre-commit hooks
- **Frontend Smoke Test:**
  - `/chat` route loads and contains expected elements
  - Static CSS/JS files are accessible
  - Gift badge animation styles and JS logic are present
- **Static Asset Verification:**
  - CSS, JS, and HTML are all served by FastAPI
- **Gift API Integration:**
  - Gift API endpoint is functional
- **Success Output:**
  - Prints a summary and a single success line if all checks pass

### 3. Script Contents

```bash
# SafeStream ‚Äî Step 8-Extended Verification Script
