# Stage 9: Moderator Dashboard Implementation (SafeStream)

## Overview
Stage 9 introduces a full-featured moderator dashboard for SafeStream, built with Streamlit. This dashboard enables real-time monitoring, moderation, and analytics for live chat events, gifts, and toxicity.

## Features Implemented
- **Streamlit Dashboard (`dashboard/app.py`)**
  - Real-time metrics polling from backend (`/metrics` endpoint)
  - Log file tailing for recent chat/gift events
  - KPI cards: Viewers, Total Gifts, Toxic %
  - Rolling table of recent messages with filtering (by username, toxicity)
  - Analytics charts: Toxicity over time, Top gifters
  - Admin actions: Kick/Mute users, manual gift trigger
  - Custom dark theme and TikTok-style accent colors
  - Auto-refresh and manual refresh controls

- **Backend Enhancements**
  - `/metrics` endpoint: Returns live metrics (viewer_count, gift_count, toxic_pct)
  - `/api/admin/reset_metrics`: Resets all metrics counters (for clean testing)
  - Gift and moderation events are logged to JSONL for dashboard consumption

- **Testing & Verification**
  - Linting and formatting enforced (Black, Ruff)
  - End-to-end and unit tests for dashboard and backend routes
  - Verification scripts updated to expect new test count
  - All code and tests pass CI and local verification

## Usage
- Start backend: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
- Start dashboard: `streamlit run dashboard/app.py`
- Access dashboard: [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)
- Reset metrics/logs for clean state:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/admin/reset_metrics
  rm logs/*.jsonl
  ```

## Notes
- Dashboard supports both metrics API and log tailing as data sources
- All admin actions are logged to console and backend
- Designed for extensibility and production-readiness
