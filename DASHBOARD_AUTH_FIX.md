# SafeStream Dashboard Authentication Fix

## Problem
The Streamlit moderator dashboard was getting "Not authenticated" errors when trying to perform admin actions like kick, mute, or changing the toxicity threshold. This was because the dashboard was making API calls to authenticated endpoints without providing JWT tokens.

## Solution
Added complete authentication system to the Streamlit dashboard:

### 🔐 Authentication Features Added

1. **Login Form in Sidebar**
   - Username/password input
   - Secure authentication via SafeStream login API
   - JWT token storage in session state

2. **Visual Authentication Status**
   - Green indicator when logged in
   - Red warning when not authenticated
   - Username display in sidebar and admin section

3. **Protected Admin Actions**
   - All admin endpoints now include Bearer token headers
   - Clear error messages when not authenticated
   - Disabled controls when not logged in

4. **Admin User Creation Script**
   - `create_admin_user.py` script for easy admin user setup
   - Interactive password input with confirmation
   - Automatic password hashing

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Create an Admin User
```bash
python3 create_admin_user.py
```

Follow the prompts to create an admin user with username/password.

### Step 2: Start the Dashboard
```bash
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

### Step 3: Login
1. In the sidebar, find the "🔐 Admin Login" section
2. Enter your admin credentials
3. Click "Login"
4. You'll see a green "✅ Logged in as [username]" message

### Step 4: Use Admin Features
Now you can:
- ✅ Kick users (complete removal from system)
- ✅ Mute users (5-minute silence)
- ✅ Adjust toxicity threshold (real-time message filtering)
- ✅ All actions are properly authenticated and logged

## 🔒 Security Features

- **JWT Token Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Session Management**: Tokens stored securely in session state
- **Logout Functionality**: Clean token removal
- **Protected Endpoints**: All admin actions require valid authentication
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear authentication status indicators

## 🎯 Fixed Issues

- ❌ **Before**: `{"detail":"Not authenticated"}` errors
- ✅ **After**: Proper JWT authentication with user-friendly login

## 📋 Authentication Flow

1. User enters credentials in sidebar login form
2. Dashboard calls `/auth/login` endpoint
3. Valid JWT token received and stored
4. All subsequent API calls include `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header
5. Admin actions work properly with full audit logging

## 🔄 Session Management

- **Login**: Stores JWT token and user info in session state
- **Logout**: Clears all authentication data
- **Auto-logout**: On token expiration (handled gracefully)
- **Visual Status**: Always shows current authentication state

The dashboard now provides a complete, secure, and user-friendly admin authentication experience!
