- Update README.md project layout to reflect static/ directory structure
- Update Dockerfile to copy static/ instead of frontend/
- Update Step8.bash verification script to check static/css/ and static/js/
- Update Step8.md documentation with new file organization

Frontend now properly organized following web standards with CSS and JS in subdirectories.
