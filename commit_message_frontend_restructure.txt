- Reorganize static files into proper directory structure:
  * Move CSS to static/css/styles.css
  * Move JS to static/js/main.js
  * Create static/index.html with correct paths
- Remove duplicate frontend directories
- Update FastAPI static file mounting to serve from static/
- Fix static file serving paths (404 errors resolved)
- Follow web standards: separate CSS/JS directories
- Improve maintainability and scalability

Frontend now properly organized with /static/css/ and /static/js/ structure.
